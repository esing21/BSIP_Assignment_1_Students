# BSIP_Assignment_1_Students
Student starting point for assignment 1 in Akeem's stats class. Clone this repository to get started. 

You'll need to create your own copy of this repository, that is available on GitHub, since that is what others will look at to evaluate your work. After you've cloned the repository, make some changes, save them, and attempt to commit those changes. You should get an error/message telling you that you dont' have permission and offering you the option to "fork". Choose the fork option. Forking the repository will create your own personal copy that you can work on and publish as your own that is also available on GitHub. After forking, on the GitHub site, under settings for the repository, ensure the visibility is public.  

The code starting point, questions, and directions are all in the notebook file.
